Hello Everyone, Welcome to build AlgoLogics, So today in this tutorial, we'll see how to write code for printing these two zigzag triangle patterns.
So, lets get started. 
before continueing with this video, if you haven't seen the video on zigzag Square pattern, 
I would highly recommend you to please watch that tutorial first and then continue with this one. 
alright, so for printing this pattern, we can reuse this triangle pattern code. here, instead of printing this star symbol, we'll print numbers in this format.
so, lets talk about how these numbers are actually printed.
